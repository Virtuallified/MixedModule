# Mixed Module v1.0

Welcome to the Mixed Module React App! This project demonstrates best practices for building a complex React application using various modules and libraries for a robust industrial-level structure. This README will guide you through the project's structure and the use of different modules and libraries.

## Basic React Structure

The project follows a standard React structure that includes the following directories:

- **src**: Contains the application source code.
  - **components**: React components used in the application.
  - **containers**: Higher-level components that connect to Redux.
  - **redux**: Redux store, actions, and reducers.
  - **services**: API services and utilities.
  - **styles**: Global CSS and styling.
  - **utils**: Helper functions and utilities.
  - **App.js**: The main application component.

## Use of React-Redux

React-Redux is used to manage the application's state and ensure data flow between components. The key components involved are:

- **Store**: The Redux store holds the application's state.
- **Actions**: Actions are dispatched to update the state.
- **Reducers**: Reducers specify how the state changes in response to actions.
- **Containers**: Higher-level components that connect to the Redux store using `connect` from `react-redux`.

## Use of redux-persist

The `redux-persist` library is used to persist the Redux store, allowing the application to rehydrate the store object across page refreshes. This ensures that the user's state remains intact.

## Use of Middleware (Thunk)

Redux Thunk is used as middleware to handle asynchronous actions in the Redux store. It enables actions to return functions, allowing for asynchronous API calls and other side effects.

## Use of Bootstrap

Bootstrap is integrated into the project for creating responsive and visually appealing UI components. You can find Bootstrap components in the `components` directory, and Bootstrap styling is applied globally in the `styles` directory.

## Use of Material UI

Material UI is used to enhance the user interface with pre-designed React components. You'll find Material UI components and theming in the `components` directory and global Material UI styling in the `styles` directory.

## Use of MUI Table with Server Side Processing

The project includes a Material UI table with server-side processing. This table efficiently handles large datasets by fetching data from the server as needed, reducing the initial load time.

## Use of Axios for API's

The Axios library is used for making API requests to a server. You'll find API service functions in the `services` directory, which leverage Axios to fetch data from external sources or your server.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/Virtuallified/MixedModule.git
   cd mixedmodule
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```shell
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the development server:

   ```shell
   npm start
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the app in action.

## Conclusion

The Mixed Module React App demonstrates how to structure and develop a robust React application using various modules and libraries. You can explore each topic mentioned in this README to gain a deeper understanding of how they are implemented in this project. Enjoy building your own React applications with this as a reference!
